    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have had to build several high performance websites.
These sites were simple sites but were heavy in images and we were
expecting large amounts of traffic.  I was using heroku to host the
sites so I could easily scale to a large number of dynos but why
have all of the excess http request for all of the assets hit my
heroku app too.</p>

<p>So I knew I was going to offload all of my images, css, fonts, and
javascript onto s3 and maybe even run cloudfront to speed things up
further, but managing:</p>

<ol>
<li>copying all of those assets to s3</li>
<li>being sure that every time I change an asset I upload it to S3</li>
<li>managing the urls to the assets</li>
</ol>


<p>was going to be a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Luckily with the help of Rails 3.2&rsquo;s asset pipeline and a little
gem called &lsquo;asset_sync&rsquo; everything can be made much simpler.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>You start by adding the gem to you Gemfile:</p>

<p><code>ruby
gem 'asset_sync'
</code>
and bundle install</p>

<p>Next we need to add the asset_host to our production.rb</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>config/environments/production.rb</h1>

<p>config.action_controller.asset_host = &ldquo;//#{ENV[&lsquo;FOG_DIRECTORY&rsquo;]}.s3.amazonaws.com&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>Then we need to set some config variables on heroku for the gem
to use.  You will need your s3 bucket name, aws access key and aws
secret key.  You can optionally add that you want the assets
gzipped and what AWS region you bucket is located in.</p>

<p>```bash
heroku config:add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxx
heroku config:add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxx
heroku config:add FOG_DIRECTORY=xxxx
heroku config:add FOG_PROVIDER=AWS</p>

<h1>and optionally:</h1>

<p>heroku config:add FOG_REGION=us-west-1
heroku config:add ASSET_SYNC_GZIP_COMPRESSION=true
```</p>

<p>If you are going to use this in production that is all you need,
but if you are running your app in any other environment
(e.g. staging) you will need to run:</p>

<p><code>bash
heroku labs:enable user-env-compile -a myapp
</code></p>

<p>Without this everything will be compiled as if in production
which may cause some issues.</p>

<p>Now the next time you push to heroku your assets will be
uploaded to s3 and all of you links/sources will point to the
s3 urls (provided you used the rails view helpers).</p>

    <id>http://mikeballou.com/blog/2012/12/25/stubbing-paperclip-attachments-in-rspec</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are using RSpec, paperclip, and your models are validating
the existence of attachments, you are going to want to
stub out the saving of the attachments.  You will want to do
this to speed up your test, keep from having extraneous files
that you need to clean up (those saved by running your test).</p>

<p>Adding the code below to my RSpec suppot folder, sped up my testing suite from 1~2 minutes to about 10-15sec.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>```ruby
module Paperclip
  class Attachment</p>

<pre><code>def save
  @queued_for_delete = []
  @queued_for_write = {}
  true
end
</code></pre>

<p>  private</p>

<pre><code>def post_process
  true
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  # This is only necessary if you&rsquo;re validating the content-type
  # class ContentTypeDetector
  # private
  #   def empty?
  #     false
  #   end
  # end
end

    <link href="http://mikeballou.com/blog/2012/12/18/taggable-mongoid-models/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-18T14:51:01-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mikeballou.com/blog/2012/12/18/taggable-mongoid-models</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was looking for a simple way to add tagging to my Mongoid 3+ models and most of the options I found were for Mongoid 2 only.  Luckily I stumbled upon Mongoid Simple Tags from Mauro Torres(<a href="https://github.com/chebyte">chebyte</a>) a ruby gem that supports Mongoid 3+.</p>

<p>Its a nice simple way to add tagging.  Simply include &ldquo;Mongoid::Document::Taggable&rdquo; to your model.</p>

<p>```ruby
class User
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Document::Taggable
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Once added you can assign tags through the #tag_list= method.  This assumes a string of comma seperated tags, which are then stored in the tags field as an array.</p>

<p><code>ruby
u = User.create(:name =&gt; "Tuquito", tag_list: "linux, tucuman, free software")
</code></p>

<!--more-->


<p>You can retrieve back comma seperated list of tags with the #tag_list method or an array of tags on the object with the #tags method.</p>

<p>```ruby
User.tag_list #=>[&ldquo;free software&rdquo;, &ldquo;linux&rdquo;, &ldquo;tucuman&rdquo;]
u.tags     # => [&ldquo;linux&rdquo;,&ldquo;tucuman&rdquo;,&ldquo;free software&rdquo;]</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Mongoid-simple-tags provides a way to search for instances with a tag via the ::tagged_with method.  This can either be given a single tag or an array of tags.  In the later case it will return all instance that have any of the given tags.  Unfortunately there is not currently a method to search for instances matching all tags in an array.</p>

<p><code>ruby
User.tagged_with("linux") # =&gt; u
User.tagged_with(["tucuman", "free software"]) # =&gt; u
</code></p>

<p>You can also get a list of all tags used on a model with there associated counts, with the ::all_tags method.  This is accomplished using MongoDb&rsquo;s map-reduce functions.</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>using map-reduce function</h1>

<p>User.all_tags #=>[{:name=>&ldquo;free software&rdquo;, :count=>1}, {:name=>&ldquo;linux&rdquo;, :count=>2}, {:name=>&ldquo;tucuman&rdquo;, :count=>1}]
```</p>

<p>Lastly, if you simply would like an array of all tags used on instances of a model there is the ::tag_list method.</p>

<p><code>ruby
User.tag_list #=&gt;["free software", "linux", "tucuman"]
</code></p>
